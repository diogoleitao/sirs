		<h2>So, who are we?</h2>
		<p>We are excited to launch our new company. After being featured in too many magazines to mention and having created an online stir, we know that our products are going to be big. You may have seen us in the Dinosaurs’ Den where we were told that we didn’t need them because we were already doing it so well ourselves, so that’s what we have continued to do. We also hope to win Startup Fictional Business of the Year this year.<br>
		Our clients range from FTSE 300 companies, to large charitable organisations and some small local businesses who are striving to expand. Most of our clients use our Data Analysis service to inform their strategic decision making and their targets for the immediate, mid-term and long-term future. The data sources that we use for this type of analysis include customer enquiry data, sales figures, costs, market data and customer feedback.
