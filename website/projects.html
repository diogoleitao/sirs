				<h3>Virtual Receptionist</h3>
				<p>Our most popular service is our Virtual Receptionist. We know that sometimes it’s difficult to get to the phone if you are in the middle of something and you don’t want to miss that important call that could be the start of an exciting new business opportunity, so let us answer it for you.Our basic package, which operates within weekday working hours, starts at £25 per month. We will answer your calls with your company name, try and put them through to you and if you can’t take it we will take a message, which we will then email or text to you – you decide.If you require a receptionist service for extended hours or to include weekends or bank holidays then we have packages that cost up to £80 and with every package you can add additional options such as voicemail services for a small additional charge.</p>
